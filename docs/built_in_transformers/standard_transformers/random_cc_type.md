The `RandomCCType` transformer is designed to populate specified database columns with random credit card types. This
tool is essential for applications that require the simulation of financial transaction data, testing payment processing
systems, or anonymizing credit card type information in datasets.

## Parameters

| Name      | Description                                       | Default | Required | Supported DB types                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| column    | The name of the column to be affected             |         | Yes      | text, varchar, char, bpchar, citext |
| keep_null | Indicates whether NULL values should be preserved | `false` | No       | -                                   |

## Description

Utilizing a predefined list of credit card types (e.g., VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), the
`RandomCCType` transformer injects random credit card type names into the designated database column. This feature
allows for the creation of realistic and varied financial transaction datasets by simulating a range of credit card
types without using real card data.

## Example: Populate random credit card types for the `transactions` table

This example shows how to configure the `RandomCCType` transformer to populate the `card_type` column in the
`transactions` table with random credit card types. It is a straightforward method for simulating diverse payment
methods across transactions.

```yaml title="RandomCCType transformer example"
- schema: "public"
  name: "transactions"
  transformers:
    - name: "RandomCCType"
      params:
        column: "card_type"
        keep_null: false
```

In this configuration, the `card_type` column will be updated with random credit card types for each entry, replacing
any existing non-NULL values. If the `keep_null` parameter is set to `true`, existing NULL values in the column will be
preserved, maintaining the integrity of records where card type information is not applicable.
