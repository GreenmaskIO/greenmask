The `RandomTollFreePhoneNumber` transformer is designed to populate specified database columns with random toll-free
phone numbers. This tool is essential for applications requiring the simulation of contact information, testing phone
number validation systems, or anonymizing phone number data in datasets while focusing on toll-free numbers.

## Parameters

| Name      | Description                                       | Default | Required | Supported DB types                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| column    | The name of the column to be affected             |         | Yes      | text, varchar, char, bpchar, citext |
| keep_null | Indicates whether NULL values should be preserved | `false` | No       | -                                   |

## Description

The `RandomTollFreePhoneNumber` transformer utilizes algorithms capable of generating random toll-free phone numbers
with various formats and injects them into the designated database column. This feature allows for the creation of
diverse and realistic toll-free contact information in datasets for development, testing, or data anonymization
purposes.

## Example: Populate random toll-free phone numbers for the `contact_information` table

This example demonstrates configuring the `RandomTollFreePhoneNumber` transformer to populate the `phone_number` column
in the `contact_information` table with random toll-free phone numbers. It is an effective method for simulating a
variety of contact information entries with toll-free numbers.

```yaml title="RandomTollFreePhoneNumber transformer example"
- schema: "public"
  name: "contact_information"
  transformers:
    - name: "RandomTollFreePhoneNumber"
      params:
        column: "phone_number"
        keep_null: false
```

In this configuration, the `phone_number` column will be updated with random toll-free phone numbers for each contact
information entry, replacing any existing non-NULL values. If the `keep_null` parameter is set to `true`, existing NULL
values in the column will be preserved, ensuring the integrity of records where toll-free phone number information is
not applicable or provided.
